clone of Netflix website built using HTML, CSS & Javascript as a Front-end. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in Javascript and CSS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page.
