Coach Geek is a LMS platform built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, JWT and many more. it still doesn't have all the features of LMS platform. it's a similar version of LMS with my own design touch, showing my abilities in Javascript and CSS to build something advanced like LMS. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, landing page, Course page, 404 page, etc.
